This is the code for the following YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42bkrj19swo&lc=UgwSRmjSHteS1GsJkKZ4AaABAg

`connect4.py` includes the implementations of the board using bitwise operations.

`mcts.py` contains the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm implementation.

`play.py` allows you to run the program on the paper games website (check out the video to see how to run).

`grid.png` is required for OpenCV to know where to look for connect 4 pieces on the website.
